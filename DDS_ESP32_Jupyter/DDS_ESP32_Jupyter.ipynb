    "The class DDS_ESP32 contains functions to comunicate with the ucontroller (computer and ESP32 must be in the same network). \n",
    "Functions to obtain the code to write into register to get the target state of the DDS, all the registers, but some of the are not parameterisated, are hard coded.  \n",
